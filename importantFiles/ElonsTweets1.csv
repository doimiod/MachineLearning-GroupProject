902,2015-01-10 10:15:10+00:00,elonmusk,Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
903,2015-01-10 17:17:15+00:00,elonmusk,"Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing."
904,2015-01-10 17:19:11+00:00,elonmusk,"Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month."

1341,2016-04-03 20:57:38+00:00,elonmusk,@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.

2143,2017-03-10 02:50:57+00:00,elonmusk,@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
2144,2017-03-10 07:05:11+00:00,elonmusk,@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
2145,2017-03-10 07:27:06+00:00,elonmusk,"@shails Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"

2149,2017-03-12 03:59:22+00:00,elonmusk,@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL
2150,2017-03-12 04:25:25+00:00,elonmusk,"@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"

3292,2018-04-01 22:02:31+00:00,elonmusk,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt
Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
3293,2018-04-01 22:02:31+00:00,elonmusk,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one)."
3294,2018-04-01 22:02:34+00:00,elonmusk,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks. 

This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?

3301,2018-04-02 18:37:37+00:00,elonmusk,"@TeslaMotorsClub Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately &amp; always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."

3303,2018-04-02 19:03:56+00:00,elonmusk,"@WSJ Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do.

3389,2018-05-04 12:04:51+00:00,elonmusk,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
3390,2018-05-04 12:21:20+00:00,elonmusk,"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."

3497,2018-05-20 06:31:40+00:00,elonmusk,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
3498,2018-05-20 06:34:02+00:00,elonmusk,@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
